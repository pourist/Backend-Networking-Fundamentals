# Backend Networking Fundamentals – Reference Guide

A concise technical guide covering the core principles of networking for backend engineers.  
Designed to give a clear understanding of how data moves from client to server, how TCP/IP underpins all network communication, and how to optimize for low latency and high throughput in backend systems.

This is an ongoing reference and will be expanded over time.
